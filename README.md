The frontend allows users to:

* Create an account and sign in
* Submit an image URL to analyze
* View the number of images submitted
* See a box drawn around each detected face

The app uses React for the UI and component logic. Key features include:

* User authentication flow
* Forms for submitting image URLs
* Fetching API data and handling responses
* Updating component state
* Displaying the bounding box over detected faces

The backend API handles the actual face detection functionality.

Getting Started
The app requires the backend API to be running - see the api repo.

To start the frontend locally:
`git clone https://github.com/user/face-recognition-frontend.git
cd face-recognition-frontend
npm install
npm start`
